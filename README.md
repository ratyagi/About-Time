# About-Time

A personal research log to track, summarize, and understand research papers I read.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Keep a structured log of research papers
- Write clear summaries of each paper
- Record understanding, questions, and reflections
- Make it easy to revisit papers later without rereading everything

This repository is a working notebook for learning through research papers.
